I'm a Cognitive Neuroscience PhD student at the University of Cambridge, based at the [Autism Research Centre](http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/) of the [Department of Psychiatry](https://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/).

For my PhD, I use a variety of cognitive neuroscience techniques, from behavioural experiments to neuroimaging, to investigate brain function, perception, and sensory processing in autism spectrum conditions. 

Broadly, my research interests lie in computational psychiatry, neuroimaging methods, data science, and anything related to the human brain ðŸ§ .

When I'm not PhD-ing, I like to unwind with horror movies, cat videos, spicy food, and 90s music. (The profile picture may have mislead you into thinking I'm a cool, sporty, outdoorsy person... I'm not.)

I'm originally from Chennai, a coastal city in South India, known for its sweltering summers and scrumptious breakfast foods.
