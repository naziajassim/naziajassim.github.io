I'm a postdoctoral researcher in cognitive neuroscience at the [Prediction and Learning Lab](https://www.lawsonlab.co.uk/), University of Cambridge, UK. 

I'm interested in how humans perceive, learn, and make decisions across different environmental contexts and how these processes may relate to mental health and neurodiversity. My research combines computational models of cognition with cognitive neuroscience methods—ranging from behavioural paradigms to ultra high-resolution 7T MRI and MR Spectroscopy—to uncover the neurocomputational mechanisms that shape human behaviour, with a focus on individual differences.

Previously, as part of the Parke-Davis Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship, I was hosted by the [Psychiatry, Embodiment and Computation Lab](https://fpetzschner.com/lab/) at the Carney Institute of Brain Science, Brown University, USA where I trained in computational modelling. For my PhD research at the [Autism Research Centre](http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/) (ARC) of the Department of Psychiatry, I investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms of perceptual inference in autism. As an Honorary Research Associate at the ARC, I continue to collaborate with the Lab on projects related to perception and cognition in autism.

When I'm not doing science or teaching, I like to unwind with my cat Sultan of Cambridge aka Sully, horror movies, spicy food, and 90s music. (The profile picture may have misled you into thinking I'm a cool, outdoorsy person... I'm not.)

I'm originally from Chennai, a coastal city in South India, known for its sweltering summers and scrumptious breakfast foods.
