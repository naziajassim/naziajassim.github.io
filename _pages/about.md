I'm a postdoc at the [Prediction and Learning Lab](https://www.lawsonlab.co.uk/), University of Cambridge, UK. As a Parke-Davis Exchange Fellow, I collaborate closely with the [Psychiatry, Embodiment and Computation Lab](https://fpetzschner.com/lab/) at the Carney Institute of Brain Science, Brown University, USA.

I use a variety of cognitive neuroscience techniques, from behavioural experiments to ultra high-resolution 7T MRI and Spectroscopy, to investigate the neurocomputational basis of perception and learning and how these processes may be implicated in conditions such as autism. For my PhD research at the [Autism Research Centre](http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/) of the [Department of Psychiatry](https://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/), I investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms of perceptual inference in autism. Aside from research, I also conduct undergraduate supervisions (i.e, small group [teaching](https://naziajassim.github.io/teaching/)) for a number of modules at the Department of Psychology.

When I'm not doing science, I like to unwind with my cat Sultan of Cambridge aka Sully, horror movies, spicy food, and 90s music. (The profile picture may have misled you into thinking I'm a cool, outdoorsy person... I'm not.)

I'm originally from Chennai, a coastal city in South India, known for its sweltering summers and scrumptious breakfast foods.
