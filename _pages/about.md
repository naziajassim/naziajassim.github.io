I'm a PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, UK.

For my PhD, I use a variety of cognitive neuroscience techniques, from behavioural experiments to neuroimaging, to investigate brain function, perception, and sensory processing in Autism Spectrum Conditions. I work with the [Autism Research Centre](http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/), the [Prediction and Learning Lab](https://www.lawsonlab.co.uk/), and the [Department of Psychiatry](https://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/). Check out my [CV](https://naziajassim.github.io/cv/) for more details. 

I also conduct undergraduate supervisions (i.e, small group [teaching](https://naziajassim.github.io/teaching/) for a number of courses at the Department of Psychology.

When I'm not PhD-ing, I like to unwind with horror movies, cat videos, spicy food, and 90s music. (The profile picture may have misled you into thinking I'm a cool, sporty, outdoorsy person... I'm not.)

I'm originally from Chennai, a coastal city in South India, known for its sweltering summers and scrumptious breakfast foods.
